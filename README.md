# High-level stuff
## Introduction
### Let's be realistic
We're bootstrapped. We're all working part time. We're not getting paid. Our chances of success are slim. 

### Our goal & vision
Inspired by bootstrapped businesses like Bascamp, our vision is to build the place where we'll want to work for the rest of our lives. 

We don't want to: 
- Become a big corporation.

We want to: 
- Have happy customers that pay for our software.



## Expectactions for all team members
### Communicate a lot
- Visit Slack once a day and let us know when you'll be off for more than a day.
- Keep the Trello board up to date
