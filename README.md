## Introduction
### Let's be realistic
We're bootstrapped. We're all working part time. We're not getting paid. Our chances of success are slim. 

### Our goal & vision
Inspired by bootstrapped businesses like Bascamp, our vision is to build the place where we'll want to work for the rest of our lives.
