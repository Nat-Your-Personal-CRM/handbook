## Introduction
### Let's be realistic
We're bootstrapped. We're all working part time. We're not getting paid. Our chances of success are slim. 

### Our goal & vision
Inspired by bootstrapped businesses like Bascamp, our vision is to build the place where we'll want to work for the rest of our lives. 

We don't want to: 
- Become a big corporation.

We want to: 
- Have happy customers that pay for our software.

## Share allocation
Company ownership and share allocation is a very complicated topic. That's why we've chosen to simplify is as much as possible. 

### Rules
- If you're getting paid money, you don't get any shares. 
- Every month you're working for Nat, you'll get 15 shares. 
- If you leave after less than 3 months, you don't get any shares. 
- You can claim the shares the first month of every year or when you leave the company. 

### How it works
Our system means that every month, we're creating new shares, diluting the existing pool of shares. This generates a healthy system where the people who've been contributing the longest own the most shares. 

### What are the 

## Expectactions for all team members
### Communicate a lot
- Visit Slack once a day and let us know when you'll be off for more than a day.
- Keep the Trello board up to date


### Make things easy for others
- Scheduling calls can be a mess. Please have a calendly.com link ready to share with the team
- If you can't make it to a meeting, say it and suggest a new time

### Own what you do
- 

### Commitment
- After the 3 month trial period, we expect you to reduce your current workload to 80% so as to be able to commit enough time to Nat. If this generates financial stress for you, we'll discuss a compensation to make it work.
